# 🎯 AnimatedAlign Task 🚀

This Flutter project demonstrates the use of the `AnimatedAlign` widget to smoothly animate an icon's position change from the bottom to the top of the screen. When the "Book your Tickets Now?" button is pressed, the airplane icon transitions from the bottom to the top center over a duration of 3 seconds, creating a visually appealing effect. The `AnimatedAlign` widget is perfect for handling such smooth position changes with ease. ✨
